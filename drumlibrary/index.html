				<p>Easily find the correct drum exercise for you. Either search by category, difficulty level or just quickly open the last exercise you were working on.

				<h2>Show me what matters.</h2>
				<p>No-nonsense. DrumLibrary clearly displays each exercise in super high resolution. Allowing you to read it from far away. Of course there are lots of features you can use but you care most about the exercise itself right?

				<h2>Tag that sh*t.</h2>
				<p>You know that exercise that you just can't get right? Mark it as your favourite (if you're a bit masochistic) or just tag multiple exercises to group them together.

				<h2>Play it until it clicks.</h2>
				<p>A drum exercise isn't a complete until you play it <em>in the right tempo</em>. That's why DrumLibrary gives you access to a super accurate metronome right where you want it. Wether you're playing an exercise or just want to quickly check a tempo, the metronome is available everywhere.
